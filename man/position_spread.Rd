\title{Spread Overlapping Grobs Spread overlapping groups by shrinking them to fit
within the data's \code{y} range.}
\usage{
position_spread(height = NULL, reverse = FALSE, padding = 0.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{height}{One of \code{total} (default), \code{panel}, \code{single}, a numeric scalar
value to give all geoms equal space, or a numeric vector the length of
\code{panels*groups} for manually specifying the height of each group.}

\item{reverse}{Reverse the order of segments within overlapping \code{y} ranges.}

\item{padding}{Multiple of height. Will shrink/enlarge groups to fit within a
region.}
}
